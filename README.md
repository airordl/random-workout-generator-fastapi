# 🏋️ Random Workout Generator

This project generates a random workout using FastAPI (Python) for the backend and HTML+JavaScript for the frontend.
It selects one random exercise from each muscle group, compound movement or full body, every time the user loads the page.

## 🧠 Pros & Cons of Randomized Training (Strength vs. Hypertrophy)

This app generates randomized workout plans. While variety can be fun and useful, it's important to understand the implications for different training goals — especially **strength** and **hypertrophy**.

---

### 🏋️ Strength Training

| ✅ Pros | ⚠️ Cons |
|--------|---------|
| Reduces overuse injuries from repeated heavy movements | Lack of consistency can hinder progressive overload |
| Encourages movement variety and skill development | No guarantee of hitting all major lifts regularly |
| Keeps training mentally fresh | Difficult to track progress on compound lifts |

---

### 💪 Hypertrophy Training (Muscle Growth)

| ✅ Pros | ⚠️ Cons |
|--------|---------|
| Hits muscles from different angles for balanced development | May not provide enough volume per muscle group per session |
| Fun and engaging, prevents boredom | Hard to apply progressive overload systematically |
| Useful for general fitness or variety days | Random selection can neglect key hypertrophy principles like time under tension or intensity |

---

### 🎯 When Randomized Training Works Best

- ✅ Beginners building general movement experience
- ✅ Cross-training, functional fitness, or “fun” sessions
- ✅ Maintenance workouts or travel/limited-equipment routines
- ✅ Mental variety to stay engaged

---

### 🚫 When It’s Not Ideal

- ❌ Serious strength athletes (powerlifting, Olympic lifting)
- ❌ Bodybuilders or physique-focused programs
- ❌ Anyone following a strict progressive training plan

---

**Conclusion:**
```bash
Randomized training is great for **novelty**, **general fitness**, or **casual users**, but should be used carefully or supplemented with structured progression for serious strength or hypertrophy goals.
```

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## 🗂 Project Structure

All files are in one folder:

```
project/
├── main.py                     ← FastAPI backend (root)
├── exercise_dictionary.json    ← Exercise data (root)
├── frontend/                   ← Frontend folder
│   ├── index.html              ← HTML UI
│   └── script.js               ← JavaScript logic
├── README.md                   ← Documentation
├── .gitignore                  ← Git ignore rules

```

---

Run main.py it with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/random-workout](http://127.0.0.1:8000/random-workout) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to test.

---

## ✅ Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. See your random workout appear on the page and refresh the page for a new set of random workouts

---

## 💡 Notes

- The backend uses a JSON dictionary to simulate a database.
- The frontend fetches data from the FastAPI endpoint.
- CORS is enabled so the browser can connect locally.
- You can easily deploy the backend with Render or Railway and host the frontend on Netlify or GitHub Pages.
