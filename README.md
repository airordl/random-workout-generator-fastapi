# 🏋️ Random Workout Generator

This project generates a random workout using FastAPI (Python) for the backend and HTML+JavaScript for the frontend.
It selects one random exercise from each muscle group, compound movement or full body, every time the user loads the page.

Not really useful for 1RM strength training, better suited for hypertrophy.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `fastapi`
- `uvicorn`

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

---

## 🗂 Project Structure

All files are in one folder:

```
project/
├── main.py                     ← FastAPI backend (root)
├── exercise_dictionary.json    ← Exercise data (root)
├── frontend/                   ← Frontend folder
│   ├── index.html              ← HTML UI
│   └── script.js               ← JavaScript logic
├── README.md                   ← Documentation
├── .gitignore                  ← Git ignore rules

```

---

Run main.py it with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/random-workout](http://127.0.0.1:8000/random-workout) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to test.

## ✅ Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. See your random workout appear on the page.

---

## 💡 Notes

- The backend uses a JSON dictionary to simulate a database.
- The frontend fetches data from the FastAPI endpoint.
- CORS is enabled so the browser can connect locally.
- You can easily deploy the backend with Render or Railway and host the frontend on Netlify or GitHub Pages.
